Basic fizzbuzz
==============

Problem
-------

Create a class that list numbers from 1 to **MAX**

Additionnal rules :
- if number is a multiple of 3 : replace number by "fizz"
- if number is a multiple of 5 : replace number by "buzz"
- if number is both multiple of 3 and 5 : replace number by "fizzbuzz"

Sample
------

Expected result with MAX = 15 :

```
1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
```
